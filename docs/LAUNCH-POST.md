# ForgeSec Launch Post

**Headline:** Security audits are too expensive. So I built an AI agent to fix that. 🛡️

**Body:**
For small businesses and NGOs, hiring a cybersecurity consultant ($5k+) is impossible. So they just... hope they don't get hacked.

That's not good enough.

Introducing **ForgeSec** by Linfy Tech Solutions.

It's an ethical AI agent that performs **Rapid Security Risk Reviews**.
✅ It assesses your setup (passwords, cloud, network).
✅ It identifies critical risks in plain English.
✅ It gives you a prioritized fix list in minutes.

**Watch the demo below.** 👇

I fed it a scenario of a small law firm using shared passwords on Dropbox.
Look at the depth of the report it generated. It flagged legal liabilities I didn't even mention.

**I'm opening 5 spots for a beta review ($199).**
If you run a small team and worry about your data, let's talk.
