# ForgeSec – Demo Video Script (2 Minutes)

**Goal:** Show a small business owner how easy it is to get a security audit.

**Scene 1: The Hook (0:00-0:30)**
- **Visual:** You on camera (or just your voice over the IDE).
- **Audio:** "Security consultants cost thousands. But what if you could get a professional risk assessment in 5 minutes? I'm Linford from Linfy Tech, and this is ForgeSec."

**Scene 2: The Input (0:30-1:00)**
- **Visual:** Show Kiro IDE with ForgeSec open.
- **Action:** Paste the "TinyLaw Firm" scenario (from Day 3).
- **Audio:** "Let's take a small law firm using shared passwords and Dropbox. I just paste their context here..."

**Scene 3: The Magic (1:00-1:30)**
- **Visual:** Watch ForgeSec generate the report live.
- **Action:** Scroll through the output as it types.
- **Audio:** "Watch this. It doesn't just say 'it's bad.' It explains WHY. It flags the legal liability. It gives a 7.6 risk score. And look—it prioritizes the fixes: 2FA first, VPN second."

**Scene 4: The Close (1:30-2:00)**
- **Visual:** Show the final Markdown report saved as a PDF.
- **Audio:** "This is a consultant-grade report, generated instantly. Defensible. Ethical. Affordable. If you want a review like this for your business, DM me 'ForgeSec'. Let's secure your data today."
